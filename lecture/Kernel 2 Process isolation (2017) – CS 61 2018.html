<h2 id="kernel-vs-process">Kernel vs. process</h2>

<p>The <strong>kernel</strong> is the piece of operating system software that runs with
full machine privilege. It starts up when the machine boots and keeps
running until the machine shuts down.</p>

<p>The software we tend to think of when we think of an operating
system—the window system, a compiler, a text editor, a web
browser—does not run with full machine privilege. It runs in
<strong>unprivileged</strong> mode, in units called <strong>processes</strong> (or <strong>user
processes</strong>).</p>

<p>A process is <strong>a program in execution.</strong> Processes come and go; they can
be started, and they can exit or be killed. A single program—that is, an
executable binary, like <code>ls</code> or <code>emacs</code>—might be running
simultaneously on the same computer in many different processes.</p>

<p>Another way to think about it is that a process is a <strong>virtual
computer.</strong> Each process can behave like it has its own processor and
memory. The operating system, and especially the kernel, manipulates the
hardware so that different processes don’t interfere inappropriately.</p>

<h2 id="starvation">Starvation</h2>

<p>The kernel aims to provide <strong>fast &amp; fair sharing of machine resources.</strong>
But true fairness is very difficult to enforce, and it’s not always the
right goal. Some processes are more important than others, and some
processes have greater or lesser resource requirements.</p>

<p>The minimal version of fairness is <strong>avoiding starvation</strong>, and almost
all OSes provide this goal.</p>

<p>Informally, a process <strong>starves</strong>, or experiences starvation, when it
gets no access to a resource. Formally, a process starves if it
<em>demands</em> the resource infinitely many times, but <em>acquires</em> the
resource only <em>finitely</em> many times. (We need the formal definition to
cover cases like if a process asks for a resource just once—for
instance, the process tries to send a single network packet, and doesn’t
succeed because the machine is too busy, but never tries again.)</p>

<p>In our Eve vs. Alice infinite-loop example, when Eve wins, Alice is
prevented from ever accessing the CPU, so Alice starves. When we
introduced timer interrupts, Eve still got to run more often—every time
Alice ran, Alice voluntarily surrendered the CPU to Eve, but Eve never
voluntarily surrendered the CPU—but Alice did not starve.</p>

<h2 id="process-isolation">Process isolation</h2>

<p>Another, more formal, way to put this goal is that the kernel aims to
provide <strong>process isolation.</strong> This means that</p>

<div class="hnote">

Processes can interact with one another only as allowed by OS policy.

</div>

<p>The introduction of policy here is what makes OSes different. Almost all
OSes include starvation avoidance in their policy. Modern OSes also aim
to isolate processes from bugs in other processes. For example, in
modern OSes, a memory bug in one process will not affect another
process, because processes have logically distinct memory spaces—each
process behaves like it has its own primary memory. But processes are
not completely isolated; communication is allowed, but it must take
place over channels allowed by policy, such as files or explicitly
shared memory.</p>

<p>(Older OSes implemented weaker forms of process isolation; for instance,
in all versions of Mac OS before Mac OS X, there was no memory
isolation, so a memory bug in one process could bring down the whole
machine!)</p>

<p>Stronger forms of process isolation are difficult to implement, because
both processes and the kernel are just software—executable instructions
telling the processor what to do. The software instructions executed by
the kernel have full control over machine resources (otherwise the OS
would be crippled). But a process with the same power could easily
violate process isolation! This is why we need need hardware help. The
hardware must offer a notion of <strong>privilege</strong>, where certain
instructions—we call them <strong>dangerous instructions</strong>—cannot be executed,
except by privileged code: the kernel.</p>

<h2 id="x8664-privilege">x86-64 privilege</h2>

<p>x86-64 computers implement privilege using a notion called the <strong>current
privilege level</strong>, or CPL. This value can be 0 or 3. (It can also be 1
or 2 but forget those, they are very rarely if ever used.) 0 means
privileged, 3 means unprivileged. This, upsettingly, means that the
<em>numerically smaller</em> privilege level means <em>higher</em> privilege. Oh well.</p>

<p>CPL is stored in a special-purpose register called the %cs register.
Historically this register was frequently used, but now it’s basically
only used to hold the CPL. Dangerous instructions check the CPL to
determine how to behave; for instance, I/O instructions, like <code>cli</code>
(disable interrupts), fault if the current CPL is too unprivileged to
perform the requested action.</p>

<p>Instructions that change the %cs register are dangerous! Code is
allowed to reduce its privilege—to go from a higher privilege level to a
lower level, i.e., from CPL 0 to CPL 3; but any attempt to <em>raise</em> the
privilege level, i.e., from CPL 3 to CPL 0, will cause a fault.</p>

<h2 id="protected-control-transfer">Protected control transfer</h2>

<p>But unprivileged code still needs to transfer control to privileged
code—for system calls, for instance. The hardware supports a mechanism
for safely raising privilege in this way, called <strong>protected control
transfer.</strong></p>

<p>On x86-64, most protected control transfer uses the processor’s
<strong>exception</strong> mechanism. An exception is an event that interrupts the
normal instruction flow, transferring control to the kernel. Exceptions
come in three varieties: a <strong>trap</strong> is initiated by software, on purpose
(e.g., the <code>int</code> instruction); an <strong>interrupt</strong> is initiated by
hardware devices, by surprise (e.g., a timer interrupt); and a <strong>fault</strong>
is initiated by the CPU, in response to a software error (e.g., a
segmentation fault or privilege violation).</p>

<p>The x86-64 CPU responds to exceptions using information pre-specified by
the kernel. Specifically, as it boots up, the kernel initializes a set
of <strong>interrupt tables</strong> (and other structures) that define, for each
kind of exception, exactly what the CPU should do. An interrupt table
entry defines these important aspects of protected control transfer:</p>

<ol>
<li>The new stack pointer;</li>
<li>The new instruction pointer;</li>
<li>And the new privilege level.</li>
</ol>

<p>To handle an exception, the CPU looks up the relevant interrupt table
entry; stores several special-purpose registers onto the defined new
stack (including the old %cs, %rsp, and %rip); and sets the new %rip and
%cs to the defined values. In your WeensyOS, the interrupt table setup
occurs in <code>k-hardware.c:segments_init</code> (using macros like
<code>set_gate</code>), and the exception handlers are located in
<code>k-exception.S</code>.</p>

<p>Protected control transfer is safe because the kernel pre-specifies
allowed entry points. If entry points were not pre-specified, and the
processor let processes jump to privileged code at any address, then
processes could probably accomplish nefarious goals and violate process
isolation by choosing just the right unexpected entry point. This would
be a <strong>privilege escalation attack</strong>, because unprivileged code was able
to effectively raise its privilege level by abusing an operating system
feature.</p>

<p>The instructions used to modify are interrupt tables (e.g., <code>lgdt</code>,
<code>lidt</code>) are, of course, dangerous—a process that can install its own
privileged exception handlers can easily escalate its privilege.</p>

<h2 id="virtual-memory">Virtual memory</h2>

<p>But it’s not only instructions that require protection. <strong>Memory</strong> also
requires protection—for instance, it contains instructions. A process
that can modify kernel code can clearly accomplish any goal that
requires privilege.</p>

<p>Modern OSes isolate process memory from kernel memory (“kernel
isolation”), and also isolate different processes’ memory from each
other. Each process has its own memory space.</p>

<p>The hardware protection mechanism used to provide this goal is <strong>virtual
memory</strong>. This is one of the coolest hardware mechanisms we’ll see,
because it’s so powerful and flexible. It supports way more than
protection; it can be used to make code much faster, and even to support
cool features like memory-mapped I/O (the <code>mmap</code> system call).</p>

<p>Virtual memory distinguishes the addresses used to refer to physical
memory chips, which are called <strong>physical addresses</strong>, from the
addresses used by software and instructions, which are called <strong>virtual
addresses</strong>. A functional procedure, implemented by the processor, maps
virtual addresses to physical addresses. Different processes can use
different procedures, giving them entirely different views of memory.</p>

<p>Different processors implement this procedure in different ways, but we
will focus on the mechanism used by x86-64, which is a <strong>multi-level
page table.</strong></p>

<h2 id="ternary-vm">Ternary VM</h2>

<p>Imagine an architecture with a total of 3<sup>3</sup> = 27 different
addresses. We’ll write addresses for this architecture in ternary
form—for example, the address 012 represents 0×3<sup>2</sup>+1×3+2 =</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>Each of those “digits” could be called a <strong>trit</strong> (a ternary bit).</li>
</ol>

<p>A multi-level page table divides addresses into parts. The least
significant part is called the <strong>offset</strong>; the more significant parts
are called <strong>indexes</strong>. In our architecture, the most-significant trit
is the level 1 index; the middle trit is the level 2 index; and the
least-significant trit is the offset.</p>

<pre><code>Address   a b c
          | | |
          | | \---&gt; offset
          | \-----&gt; level 2 index
          \-------&gt; level 1 index
</code></pre>

<p>Or, in code:</p>

<pre><code>PAGEOFFSET(addr) = addr % 3
L1PAGEINDEX(addr) = (addr / 3) % 3
L2PAGEINDEX(addr) = addr / 9
</code></pre>

<p>The processor translates virtual to physical addresses using the indexes
and offset. The lookup procedure starts from a special-purpose register
called <code>%cr3</code> (the same name as in x86-64). This register holds the
<strong>physical</strong> address of the <em>level 1 page table page</em> (also called the
“level 1 page table”). (All general-purpose registers hold virtual
addresses, as do %rip, %rsp, etc.; really only %cr3 and one or two other
special-purpose registers hold physical addresses.) Each page table page
holds an array of addresses. The level 1 index is used to index into
this array, obtaining the physical address of the <em>level 2 page table
page</em>. The level 2 index is used to index into <em>that</em> array, obtaining
the physical address of the <em>destination physical page</em>, an array of
bytes. Finally, the offset is used to index into that page, obtaining
the physical address.</p>

<p>The following pseudo-code makes this
concrete.</p>

<pre><code>address_t ternary_virtual_to_physical(uintptr_t va, address_t cr3, int access_type) {
    cur_pt = cr3;
    for (int level = 0; level &lt; 2; ++level) {
        index = (va / (3 ** (2 - level))) % 3;   // compute index
        entry = cur_pt[index];   // NB uses physical addressing
        if (access_type is not allowed by entry)
            FAULT;
        cur_pt = entry aligned to a page boundary;
    }
    return cur_pt + (va % 3);    // apply offset
}
</code></pre>

<p>Consider the following contents of ternary memory. We divide ternary
memory up into “pages” consisting of three addresses each; all addresses
in the same page share the same indexes, but can have different offsets.
We write a page by listing the three offsets in order. The page
addresses are physical, not virtual.</p>

<pre><code>page 00*   page 01*   page 02*
  000        100        200
  010        110        210
  020        120        220
</code></pre>

<pre><code>page 10*   page 11*   page 12*
  000        001        002
  000        001        002
  000        001        002
</code></pre>

<pre><code>page 20*   page 21*   page 22*
  100        120        200
  110        120        210
  120        120        220
</code></pre>

<p>What happens if %cr3 holds physical address 000?</p>

<p>This is what we call an <strong>identity mapping</strong>: every virtual address is
numerically identical to the corresponding physical address; the memory
with virtual address <em>N</em> is located at physical address <em>N</em>. To see how,
consider the virtual address 122. Here’s how the lookup works:</p>

<ul>
<li>The level 1 index, 1, is applied to the level 1 page table page,
which is at physical address 000. This gives physical address 010
for the level 2 page table page.</li>
<li>The level 2 index, 2, is applied to the level 2 page table page.
This gives physical address 120 for the destination physical page.</li>
<li>The offset, 2, is applied to that page’s address, giving 122!</li>
</ul>

<p>A similar thing happens with address 002.</p>

<ul>
<li>The level 1 index, 0, is applied to the level 1 page table page,
which is at physical address 000. This gives physical address 000
for the level 2 page table page. Note that this is <strong>the same
address</strong> as the level 1 page table page, but now we are treating
that physical memory as a level 2 page table page!</li>
<li>The level 2 index, 0, is applied to the level 2 page table page,
giving physical address 000 for the destination physical page.</li>
<li>The offset, 2, is applied to that page’s address, giving 002!</li>
</ul>

<p>But the identity mapping only holds when %cr3 is 000. If %cr3 is 100,
for example, the mapping is not an identity. When %cr3 is 100, then only
physical pages 000, 010, and 020 are accessible.</p>

<p>But real multi-level page tables have additional features that support
distinguishing privileged and unprivileged accesses, and that allow us
to cut off some lookups into off-limits memory. Consider this set of
memory:</p>

<pre><code>page 00*   page 01*   page 02*
  010        000         -
  110U       010        blub
   F         020         -
</code></pre>

<pre><code>page 10*   page 11*   page 12*
  010        200U       200U
  120U       210U       220U
   F          F          F
</code></pre>

<pre><code>page 20*   page 21*   page 22*
   -          -          -
 chirp       meow        -
   -          -         bark
</code></pre>

<p>We write “U” after an address to indicate that the corresponding entry
is accessible to unprivileged processes; if an entry has no “U”, then
unprivileged accesses to that entry will cause a fault. An entry that
says “F” always causes a fault, whether or not the accessing code has
privilege.</p>

<p>Here are some facts about this memory, which you should verify by
drawing arrows and working through the examples.</p>

<ul>
<li>If %cr3 = 000, then unprivileged code can only access physical pages
200 and 210. Specifically, virtual addresses 100-102 correspond to
physical addresses 200-202, and virtual addresses 110-112 correspond
to physical addresses 210-212.</li>
<li>If %cr3 = 000, then privileged code can additionally access physical
pages 000, 010, and 020, using identity mappings for addresses
000-022.</li>
<li>If %cr3 = 000, then unprivileged code can access the bird and the
cat (using what virtual addresses?). Privileged code can
additionally access the fish.</li>
<li>If %cr3 = 000, then no code can access virtual address 120-222;
these addresses fault.</li>
</ul>

<!-- end list -->

<ul>
<li>If %cr3 = 100, then unprivileged code can only access physical pages
200 and <strong>220</strong>. Specifically, virtual addresses 100-102 correspond
to physical addresses 200-202, and virtual addresses 110-112
correspond to physical addresses 220-222.</li>
<li>If %cr3 = 100, then privileged code can additionally access physical
addresses 000-022 using identity mappings. Note that %cr3 000 and
100 share the same level-2 page table page for kernel mappings.</li>
<li>If %cr3 = 100, then unprivileged code can access the bird and the
dog (using what virtual addresses?). Privileged code can
additionally access the fish.</li>
</ul>

<p>So we see some shared memory (e.g., unprivileged code using either page
table can access the bird at the same address), and some independent
memory (e.g., virtual address 110 maps to different physical memory on
the two page tables).</p>
